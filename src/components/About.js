                <p>
                I graduated from university in 2021 with a strong passion for coding, communicating, and problem-solving. 
                Probably sounds super generic but it's the truth!
                Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have gained proficiency in various programming languages and technologies; 
                frequently attending tech events in London and engaging in personal programming projects, 
                further expanding my knowledge and staying current with industry trends.
